# Self-Driving-Car
This project demonstrates the implementation of a self-driving car using deep learning techniques for predicting actions in the Udacity car simulator. By training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, the car learns to navigate through various scenarios in the simulator.


## Introduction

Self-driving cars represent a significant advancement in autonomous vehicle technology. This project focuses on utilizing deep learning algorithms to predict appropriate actions for steering the car within the simulated environment provided by Udacity.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Implement a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras to predict steering angles based on input images from the car's front camera.
- **Simulator Integration**: Interface the deep learning model with the Udacity car simulator for real-time prediction and control.
- **Training Pipeline**: Develop a training pipeline to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance using simulation metrics.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Provide visualizations of the car's performance in different scenarios, including lane following, obstacle avoidance, and more.
